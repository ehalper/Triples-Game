# Triples iOS Game Application
The Triples iOS application is a game that follows similar logic to the game, Threes. It has two game modes: random and deterministic. The random mode will randomly initialize the starting locations of the four tiles, and the deterministic mode will always initialize the board the same way. In addition to the directional tap buttons on the screen, swipe gestures for indicating directional moves are recognized. The application also displays tile movement animations to demonstrate when the tiles change values. A tab for viewing a page that maintains the user's high scores using persistence is also included. The game can be played in both vertical and horizontal orientations as it adjusts the screen's layout when the orientation changes.
